# GPX reverser by LB4FH

Tool for reversing GPX tracks, useful for many things. 

Usage: `gpxreverser.exe track.gpx`

Outputs reversed track as "inputfilename-reversed.gpx"

## How it works

The track is loaded, and all points are reversed and put into a single track segment. Time is not reversed, so it will be inaccurate.
